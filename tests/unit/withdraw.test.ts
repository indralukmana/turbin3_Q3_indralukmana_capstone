/*
 * NOTE: These are placeholder tests due to limitations in the current testing framework.
 * The Anchor testing framework with `vitest` does not support the complex scenarios
 * required for comprehensive testing of the withdrawal logic.
 *
 * These tests only verify that:
 * 1. The withdraw instruction exists and can be called
 * 2. The basic error handling works (e.g., rejecting withdrawals when streak target is not met)
 *
 * COMPREHENSIVE TESTING WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN A FUTURE PHASE
 * WHEN A TESTING FRAMEWORK WITH ADVANCED CAPABILITIES IS AVAILABLE.
 *
 * REAL TESTS SHOULD VERIFY:
 * - Successful withdrawal when streak target is met
 * - Rejection of withdrawal when streak target is not met
 * - Proper transfer of SOL from vault to user wallet
 * - Proper closing of vault account
 * - CPI interaction with nft-minter program
