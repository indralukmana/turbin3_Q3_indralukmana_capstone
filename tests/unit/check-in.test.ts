/*
 * NOTE: These are placeholder tests due to limitations in the current testing framework.
 * The Anchor testing framework with `vitest` does not support time manipulation,
 * which is required for comprehensive testing of the check-in time window logic.
 *
 * These tests only verify that:
 * 1. The check_in instruction exists and can be called
 * 2. The basic error handling works (e.g., rejecting check-ins that are too early)
 *
 * COMPREHENSIVE TIME-BASED TESTING WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN A FUTURE PHASE
 * WHEN A TESTING FRAMEWORK WITH TIME MANIPULATION CAPABILITIES IS AVAILABLE.
 *
 * REAL TESTS SHOULD VERIFY:
 * - Valid check-in within the 20-48 hour window
 * - Check-in that is too early (less than 20 hours since last check-in)
 * - Check-in that is too late (more than 48 hours since last check-in)
 * - Proper streak counter increment
 * - Proper timestamp updates
