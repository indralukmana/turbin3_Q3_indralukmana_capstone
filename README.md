# Gamified SRS for Solana Developers - Proof of Discipline

This project is a Gamified Spaced Repetition System (SRS) for Solana developers,
featuring a unique "Proof of Discipline" mechanism built on the Solana
blockchain with Anchor.

## üìú Executive Summary

This project initiates the development of a Gamified Spaced Repetition System
(SRS) specifically tailored for Solana developers. The platform aims to enhance
learning efficiency for complex Solana technologies (Rust, Anchor, SPL,
Metaplex) by combining proven SRS techniques with light gamification. The key
innovation is the integration of a unique, trustless "Proof of Discipline"
mechanism, where users initialize a vault with SOL as a commitment to their
learning goals. Daily on-chain actions are required to maintain the streak;
successful completion unlocks the deposit and grants a verifiable,
permissionless NFT credential, serving as a blockchain-based proof of dedication
and mastery.

## üéØ Project Overview

### The Problem

Mastering the Solana development stack is challenging. Existing resources often
lack structured methods for long-term knowledge retention (like SRS) and fail to
provide compelling motivation for consistent study, leading to high drop-off
rates for aspiring developers.

### The Solution

We are building a Gamified SRS platform that combines:

1. **Spaced Repetition:** To optimize long-term retention of complex Solana
   concepts.
2. **Trustless Commitment Vault:** A core feature where users lock SOL in an
   on-chain vault to commit to a learning streak. Daily on-chain "check-ins" are
   required. The smart contract enforces the rules, returning the SOL only upon
   successful completion.
3. **Permissionless NFT Credentials:** Upon completing a streak, users can mint
   a unique NFT as a verifiable proof of their achievement and dedication.

## ‚ú® Core Features

The core of this project is built around two Solana Anchor programs:

- **`srs-vault` Program:**
  - Allows users to initialize a vault, depositing SOL as a commitment.
  - Tracks a user's daily "check-in" streak using on-chain timestamps.
  - Enforces the rules of the commitment (e.g., daily check-in window).
  - Upon successful completion of the streak, returns the user's SOL.
  - Issues a secure, single-use "Mint Permit" via a Cross-Program Invocation
    (CPI) to the `nft-minter` program.

- **`nft-minter` Program:**
  - A permissionless program that mints a verifiable NFT credential.
  - Requires a valid "Mint Permit" from the `srs-vault` program to authorize the
    mint.
  - Consumes the permit after minting to ensure it cannot be reused.
  - The NFT metadata reflects the details of the user's achievement (e.g.,
    streak length, completion date).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
